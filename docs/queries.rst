Queries
-------

Given the above tab structure, our application fires index and detail query actions based on the above URLs in all cases. 
Our application also fires an action when a tab is clicked on or navigated to with the type ``'pillId.pillId.pillId...'``. This can be captured and is used to fire query for one off Detail tabs.
